Answer the questions in this file after running AFL and IKOS on the
all the C programs. The questions are organized into two parts: Part A
concerns with the performance of the tools on programs,
and Part B concerns with the nature of the tools itself.

Part A: Follow the below instructions to fill in the table below.

Each of the C programs contains zero or more division instructions.

First, inspect the code of each program, and fill in its ground truth
(right/wrong) in the Ground Truth column: 

- right if the program does not contain any divide-by-zero errors.
- wrong if the program contains a divide-by-zero error.

Next, refer to the logs of each analyzer's run on each program, and fill
in its result (accept/reject) in the respective column:

- accept if your analyzer does not report any divide-by-zero errors.
- reject if your analyzer reports a divide-by-zero error.

Lastly, use the above computed results to calculate Precision, Recall,
and F-Measure scores for each analyzer on this suite of programs.

===========================================================================
| Program   | Ground Truth  |     AFL      | IKOS Interval |   IKOS DBM   |
|=========================================================================|
| test0.c   |   right       |    accept    |    accept     |    accept    |
| test1.c   |   wrong       |    reject    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test2.c   |   wrong       |    reject    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test3.c   |   right       |    accept    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test4.c   |   right       |    accept    |    reject     |    accept    |
| test5.c   |   wrong       |    accept    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test6.c   |   wrong       |    reject    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test7.c   |   wrong       |    reject    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test8.c   |   wrong       |    accept    |    reject     |    reject    |
| test9.c   |   wrong       |    reject    |    reject     |    reject    |
|=========================================================================|
| Precision |     1         |     1        |     0.778     |     0.875    |
| Recall    |     1         |     0.714    |     1         |     1        |
| F-measure |     1         |     0.833    |     0.875     |     0.933    |

Part B: Answer the below questions. Provide short
explanations to justify your answers.

Question 1: From the given programs, can AFL be a sound analysis? Can it be complete?
Answer:
      
      It is not sound since when test5 is wrong and AFL still accept. It is complete since test0, test3 and test4 are correct and they are accepted.


Question 2: From the given programs, can IKOS interval be a sound analysis? Can it be complete?
Answer:

      It is a sound analysis since it only accepts tests that are true but it is not complete since it doesn't accept test3 and test4 which are true.


Question 3: From the given programs, can IKOS DBM be a sound analysis? Can it be complete?
Answer:
      
      It can be a sound analysis since it only accepts test0 and test4, which are true. It is not a complete analysis since
      it rejects test3 which is true. 



Question 4: What are the pros and cons of using the Interval versus DBM
domains in IKOS to find divide-by-zero errors?  Comment
on both the accuracy and cost of the analyzer under these two domains.

Answer: Interval is usually less expensive than DBM but it also has a lower precision and F-measure value than DBM.
